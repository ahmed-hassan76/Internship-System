# Internship-System
The GUC Internship System is a comprehensive web application designed to streamline the internship process for students, companies, faculty academics, and the SCAD office at the German University in Cairo. The project is divided into three milestones, each focusing on different aspects of software development, from requirements engineering to front-end design. Milestone part 1 involves Requirements Engineering, where teams manually draft 50 functional requirements (without AI) for the system, covering modules such as Profile Management, Internship Search & Recruitment, and Evaluation & Reporting. These requirements are later refined using AI (ChatGPT) to improve clarity and completeness. Part 2 extends the requirements by introducing 50 new functional requirements and 7 non-functional requirements, initially generated using AI and then manually improved. The focus remains on digitizing internship submissions, evaluations, and post-internship processes. Milestone 2 shifts to UI/UX development, where teams design a fully functional front-end prototype using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The prototype must align with the requirements from Milestone 1 and adhere to UX principles such as learnability, efficiency, consistency, and responsiveness.
