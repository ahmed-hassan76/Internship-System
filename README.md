# GUC Internship System

## Overview

The **GUC Internship System** is a comprehensive web application developed to streamline and digitize the internship lifecycle at the **German University in Cairo (GUC)**. The system serves multiple stakeholders—including students, companies, faculty academics, and the SCAD office—by centralizing internship applications, evaluations, and reporting into a unified platform.

The project is structured into **three milestones**, each targeting a specific phase of the software development lifecycle, from requirements engineering to front-end design and usability.

## Project Milestones

### 📌 Milestone 1 – Requirements Engineering

Milestone 1 focuses on establishing a solid foundation through detailed requirements analysis and documentation.

#### Part 1: Manual Requirements Definition

* Teams manually draft **50 functional requirements** (without the use of AI).
* Requirements cover core system modules, including:

  * **Profile Management**
  * **Internship Search & Recruitment**
  * **Evaluation & Reporting**
* After completion, the requirements are refined using **AI (ChatGPT)** to enhance clarity, consistency, and completeness.

#### Part 2: AI-Assisted Requirements Expansion

* An additional **50 functional requirements** are introduced.
* **7 non-functional requirements** are defined, addressing aspects such as performance, usability, and reliability.
* Requirements are initially generated using AI, then **manually reviewed and improved** by the team.
* Emphasis is placed on:

  * Digitizing internship submissions
  * Automating evaluations
  * Supporting post-internship processes

### 🎨 Milestone 2 – UI/UX Design & Front-End Development

Milestone 2 translates the documented requirements into a tangible user experience.

* A fully functional **front-end prototype** is developed using:

  * **HTML**
  * **CSS**
  * **JavaScript**
* The prototype strictly aligns with the requirements defined in **Milestone 1**.
* The design adheres to key **UI/UX principles**, including:

  * **Learnability** – easy for new users to understand
  * **Efficiency** – optimized workflows for frequent users
  * **Consistency** – uniform design patterns across the system
  * **Responsiveness** – compatibility across different screen sizes and devices

## Objective

The ultimate goal of the GUC Internship System is to modernize and simplify the internship process, reduce manual paperwork, improve communication between stakeholders, and ensure a smooth, transparent, and efficient internship experience for all parties involved.
